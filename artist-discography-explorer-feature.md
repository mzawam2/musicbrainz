# Feature Specification: Artist Discography Explorer

## Overview

The Artist Discography Explorer is a comprehensive feature that extends the current Angular application's artist search functionality to provide users with detailed discography information, including albums, singles, tracks, and chronological release timelines.

## Current Application Analysis

### Existing Features
- ✅ Artist search with debounced input and intelligent caching
- ✅ Label discovery showing record labels associated with selected artists
- ✅ Label grid with advanced sorting and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Accessibility features and comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Responsive design with Material UI components

### Current Limitations

- No individual song/recording details
- No cover art or media integration

## Recommended Feature: Artist Discography Explorer

### Strategic Rationale

**Why This Feature?**
1. **Natural Progression**: Logical extension of existing artist search functionality
2. **Data Richness**: Leverages Release Groups, Releases, Recordings, and Works entities from MusicBrainz API
3. **High User Value**: Provides comprehensive artist information that users naturally expect
4. **Visual Appeal**: Enables attractive timeline layouts and rich media presentation
5. **Incremental Development**: Can be implemented progressively from basic to advanced features

### Technical Architecture

**MusicBrainz Entities Utilized:**
- **Release Groups**: Abstract album concepts for grouping related releases
- **Releases**: Specific physical/digital releases with detailed metadata
- **Recordings**: Individual track audio data with duration and ISRC codes
- **Works**: Compositions and songwriting credits
- **Areas**: Geographic context for release information

**Integration Points:**
- Extends existing `MusicBrainzService` with new API endpoints
- Utilizes current caching mechanisms for performance optimization
- Builds on established component architecture patterns
- Maintains existing accessibility and error handling standards
