## API Integration

### MusicBrainz Service

The `MusicBrainzService` provides typed access to the MusicBrainz API:

```typescript
// Artist search with debounced input
searchArtists(query: string, limit: number = 10): Observable<MusicBrainzArtist[]>

// Release lookup with label information
getArtistReleases(artistId: string, limit: number = 100): Observable<MusicBrainzRelease[]>

// Label aggregation with release counting
getArtistLabels(artistId: string): Observable<LabelWithReleaseCount[]>

// Private method for label data processing
private aggregateLabels(releases: MusicBrainzRelease[]): LabelWithReleaseCount[]
```

### Proxy Configuration

Development requests are proxied through `proxy.conf.json` to handle CORS:

```json
{
  "/api/*": {
    "target": "https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2",
    "headers": {
      "User-Agent": "AngularPlayground/1.0.0 (claude-assistant@example.com)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Models

Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for MusicBrainz API responses:

- `MusicBrainzArtist` - Artist information with metadata
- `MusicBrainzRelease` - Release details with label info
- `MusicBrainzLabel` - Record label data
- `LabelWithReleaseCount` - Aggregated label statistics

## Component Stories

### HomeComponent

**Purpose**: Main search interface for artist discovery

**Features**:
- Reactive search input with `FormControl`
- Debounced API calls (300ms) using RxJS operators
- Loading states with spinner animation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Artist selection with detailed information display

**User Flows**:
1. User types artist name â†’ Debounced search triggers
2. API results display in dropdown â†’ User clicks to select
3. Selected artist shows detailed info â†’ Automatic label lookup begins
4. Label grid displays with release counts â†’ Sorted by activity level

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// Search for "Beatles" â†’ Shows "The Beatles" â†’ Displays labels like "Apple Records", "Capitol Records"
// Search for "Radiohead" â†’ Shows band â†’ Displays "XL Recordings", "Capitol Records", etc.
// Search for "Miles Davis" â†’ Shows jazz artist â†’ Displays "Columbia Records", "Blue Note Records"
```

### LabelGridComponent

**Purpose**: Display collection of record labels in responsive grid layout

**Features**:
- Responsive CSS Grid with auto-fill columns (min 300px)
- Loading state with animated spinner
- Error state with user-friendly messaging
- Empty state for artists without label information
- Label count summary header

**States**:
- Loading: Shows spinner with "Loading record labels..." message
- Error: Displays error icon and specific error message
- Empty: Shows label icon with "No Labels Found" message
- Success: Grid of label cards sorted by release count

### LabelCardComponent

**Purpose**: Individual label information card with release statistics

**Features**:
- Professional card design with hover animations
- Gradient release counter with singular/plural text handling
- Label metadata display (type, label code, disambiguation)
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Visual hierarchy with typography and color coding

**Data Display**:
- Primary: Label name and release count
- Secondary: Label type, label code (LC number)
- Tertiary: Disambiguation text and MusicBrainz ID

### LoadingSpinnerComponent

**Purpose**: Reusable loading indicator with configurable sizing

**Features**:
- Three size variants: small (20px), medium (40px), large (60px)
- Customizable message text
- Consistent animation and branding
- Accessible design with proper contrast ratios

**Usage**:
```html
<app-loading-spinner message="Loading artists..." size="medium"></app-loading-spinner>
```

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm start              # Start development server
npm run build          # Build for production
npm run watch          # Build with file watching
npm test              # Run unit tests
```

### Library Development

```bash
ng build @nationwide/my-lib      # Build custom library
ng test @nationwide/my-lib       # Test library components
```

## Implementation Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Functionality (Complete)
- Environment and HttpClient setup
- MusicBrainz API integration with proper headers
- Artist search with reactive forms
- HomeComponent with autocomplete
- Error handling and loading states

### âœ… Phase 2: Label Integration (Complete)
- Release lookup by artist ID with label information
- Label data aggregation and release counting
- LabelGridComponent with responsive design
- LabelCardComponent with professional styling
- LoadingSpinnerComponent for reusable loading states
- Enhanced HomeComponent with integrated label workflow

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Polish (Future)
- Advanced autocomplete with highlighting
- Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels)
- Performance optimizations and caching
- Additional label metadata and filtering options

## API Rate Limiting

MusicBrainz API has a 1 request/second rate limit. The service includes:
- Built-in 1000ms delay between requests
- Proper User-Agent header via proxy
- Error handling for rate limit responses (429)

## Testing

Try these artist searches to test full functionality:

### Artist Search Testing:
- **"Beatles"** â†’ Multiple results with disambiguation â†’ Select "The Beatles" â†’ See Apple Records, Capitol Records
- **"Radiohead"** â†’ Band with clear metadata â†’ See XL Recordings, Capitol Records, etc.
- **"Miles Davis"** â†’ Jazz artist with life span data â†’ See Columbia Records, Blue Note Records
- **"Bob Dylan"** â†’ Prolific artist â†’ See Columbia Records with high release count
- **"xyz123"** â†’ Tests error handling for both artist search and label lookup

### Label Integration Testing:
- Select any artist to trigger automatic label lookup
- Observe loading states during API calls
- Check responsive grid layout on different screen sizes
- Verify release count sorting (highest counts first)
- Test error handling when API fails

## Architecture Notes

- **Angular 19**: Latest features including control flow (`@if`, `@for`)
- **Standalone Components**: No NgModules, modern Angular architecture  
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming with operators for API calls
- **SCSS**: Styled with modern CSS features and animations
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for API responses and component state
